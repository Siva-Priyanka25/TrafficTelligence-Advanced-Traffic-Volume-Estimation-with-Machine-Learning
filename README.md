# TrafficTelligence-Advanced-Traffic-Volume-Estimation-with-Machine-Learning
🚦 Project Overview
Trafficeteligence is a smart solution that utilizes Machine Learning (ML) to estimate traffic volume accurately in real-time. This project aims to help urban planners and traffic control systems make data-driven decisions to optimize traffic flow, reduce congestion, and enhance road safety.

📌 Key Features
📹 Analyzes traffic video/image data
🧠 Applies ML models to predict traffic volume
⏱ Real-time or batch traffic estimation
📊 Dashboard integration for visualization (optional)
🛣 Supports scalable deployment for smart cities
🧰 Technologies Used
Python 🐍
OpenCV for video/image processing
Scikit-learn / XGBoost / TensorFlow (any ML library used)
Pandas, NumPy for data handling
Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualization
Flask for web integration (optional)
Jupyter Notebooks for development and experimentation
